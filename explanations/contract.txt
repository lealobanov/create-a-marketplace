The NFT Storefront contract enables users to list their NFTs for sale on a marketplace, purchase NFTs from others, borrow listings, and perform various other operations related to managing and interacting with the Storefront. To use these features, a user must first create a Storefront resource from the NFT Storefront contract and save it to their account. This Storefront resource acts as a gateway to functionalities such as creating and removing listings, retrieving and borrowing listings, cleaning up outdated listings, and even destroying the Storefront itself when no longer needed.

The createStorefront function facilitates this process, allowing anyone to easily create and save a Storefront resource to their account, unlocking full access to the Storefrontâ€™s capabilities.
