The NFT Storefront contract is used to be able to list NFTS that a user owns for sale on your marketplace. Users can also purchase other NFTS, borrow listings, and do tons of other things related to the Storefront contract.

Before doing any of this, you need to create a Storefront resource from the NFTStorefront contract and save it to your account. Once that resource is saved you then have access to the Storefront resource which will give you the ability to create listings, remove listings, getListings, borrowListings, cleanupListings, and destroy your own Storefront.

The createStorefront function allows anyone to create a storefront and save it to their account.
